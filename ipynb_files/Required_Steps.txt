What I missed? REQUIRED STEPS TO TAKE FOR PRESENTATION OF ML PROJECT
Steps:

- Explain the Main Idea. 
- Clean and Code DataSet
- Make a decent Visualization for clear explanation.
- Chose the right model from as many as possible.
- Make a dataframe with an accuracy of each Model.

- Hyperparameters TUNING

- accuracy, f1, recall, etc. AUC

- Make a couple of Tests to prove specific hypothesis:
    - Feature Test. (Features importance test)
    - T-test
    - Chi square test.(for categorical variables, how they impact on target)
    - etc. Imbalance test..

- How fast specific algorithms are. Visualize with matplotlib.

Sources: Pandas profiling, Optuna, Feature tools

? - Tell the difference between gradient boosting and random forest, to be concise, grind every algoriths and boosting algorithms.
? - What is target-meaning-encoding?
? - pipeline, baseline?
? - out of sample and out of time validation - must to know what it is...

If you really want AUC score, just make a binary classification [0, 1, 2, 3] = 0 and [4, 5, 6] = 1. You got this!
P.S: binary classification didn't worked out for my case because of the highest auc score.

THE END.

Deploy

ADDITIONAL STEPS:
- difference between gradient boosting and random forest (grind as a junkie)
- begging and boosting?

revise each ml algorithm [regression, classification, and clustering]
