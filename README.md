#Couple of words

There are 3 models to be precise:
1. NBA Points Prediction. Using linear regression I got a pretty high result with R squared somewhere around 84%
2. Imon-International Bank. Credit scoring approval. I used binary classification for that one.
Deployment of these models using streamlit library: https://ml-repo.streamlit.app/
I used streamlit library for my first deployments, but it's more appropriate to use FastAPI or Flask as a backend and React as a frontend tech stack aiming for high quality product and interactive user experience.
