**Short-description**

There are 3 models to be precise:
1. NBA Points Prediction. Using linear regression I got a pretty high result with R squared somewhere around 84%
2. Imon-International Bank. Credit scoring approval. I used binary classification for that one.
3. Obesity Level Prediction. Multi-Classification.

Deployment of these models using streamlit library: https://ml-repo.streamlit.app/

I used the streamlit library for my first deployments. Still, it's more appropriate to use FastAPI or Flask as a backend and React as a frontend tech stack, which I'm supposed to do, aiming for a high-quality product and interactive user experience.
